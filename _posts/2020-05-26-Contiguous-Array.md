Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
```
Example 2:
Input: [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

## Solution

Let's have a variable count initially equals 0 and traverse through nums. Every time we meet a 0, we decrease count by 1, and increase count by 1 when we meet 1. It's pretty easy to conclude that we have a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1 when count equals 0.

What if we have a sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]? the maximum length is 4, the count starting from 0, will equal -1, -2, -3, -4, -3, -2, and won't go back to 0 again. But wait, the longest subarray with equal number of 0 and 1 started and ended when count equals -2. We can plot the changes of count on a graph, as shown below. Point (0,0) indicates the initial value of count is 0, so we count the sequence starting from index 1. The longest subarray is from index 2 to 6.

From above illustration, we can easily understand that two points with the same y-axis value indicates the sequence between these two points has equal number of 0 and 1.

Another example, sequence [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], as shown below,

There are 3 points have the same y-axis value -2. So subarray from index 2 to 4 has equal number of 0 and 1, and subarray from index 4 to 8 has equal number of 0 and 1. We can add them up to form the longest subarray from index 2 to 8, so the maximum length of the subarray is 8 - 2 = 6.

Yet another example, sequence [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0], as shown below. The longest subarray has the y-axis value of 0.

To find the maximum length, we need a dict to store the value of count (as the key) and its associated index (as the value). We only need to save a count value and its index at the first time, when the same count values appear again, we use the new index subtracting the old index to calculate the length of a subarray. A variable max_length is used to to keep track of the current maximum length.

```
class Solution(object):
    def findMaxLength(self, nums):
        count = 0
        max_length=0
        table = {0: 0}
        for index, num in enumerate(nums, 1):
            if num == 0:
                count -= 1
            else:
                count += 1
            
            if count in table:
                max_length = max(max_length, index - table[count])
            else:
                table[count] = index
        
        return max_length
```
